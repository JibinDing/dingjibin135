Both approaches have their pros and cons, and the choice depends on factors such as performance, data consistency, and the frequency of updates. Here’s a breakdown of the two approaches to help you decide:

Option 1: Store All-Time Statistics for Each Repository and Aggregate When Displaying

How It Works

	•	Store all-time statistics (e.g., number of PRs, large commits, etc.) for each repository in the database.
	•	When displaying team-level statistics, aggregate these values in real time by summing up the statistics for all repositories of the team.

Advantages

	1.	Accuracy:
	•	Data is always up-to-date because it’s derived directly from the repository statistics.
	•	No risk of inconsistencies in pre-aggregated data.
	2.	Flexibility:
	•	You can easily adjust the aggregation logic (e.g., filter by date range or specific repositories) without needing to modify stored data.
	3.	Storage Efficiency:
	•	Avoids storing duplicate aggregated data for teams.
	4.	Simpler Updates:
	•	When repository-level statistics change, you only need to update the repository data, not team-level aggregations.

Disadvantages

	1.	Performance Overhead:
	•	Aggregating statistics for teams requires more computation, especially if the team has many repositories.
	•	May impact performance for large datasets or frequent requests.
	2.	Database Load:
	•	Increases the load on the database when querying team-level statistics in real time.

Use Case

	•	Suitable if team statistics are not requested frequently or if your system can handle the computational load.

Option 2: Pre-Aggregate and Store Team-Level Statistics

How It Works

	•	Periodically calculate and store aggregated team-level statistics based on repository data.
	•	When displaying team data, fetch the pre-aggregated result directly.

Advantages

	1.	Fast Retrieval:
	•	Team-level statistics are precomputed, so displaying them is instantaneous.
	•	Ideal for dashboards where performance is critical.
	2.	Reduced Query Complexity:
	•	Simplifies queries for team statistics since aggregation is not required at query time.
	3.	Lower Database Load:
	•	Reduces computational load on the database during user requests.

Disadvantages

	1.	Data Consistency:
	•	Risk of stale or inconsistent data if repository statistics change but the aggregated values are not updated promptly.
	2.	Update Complexity:
	•	Requires additional logic to ensure team-level statistics are updated whenever repository data changes.
	3.	Increased Storage:
	•	Requires additional storage for team-level statistics, which may lead to redundancy.

Use Case

	•	Suitable if team statistics are requested frequently or need to be displayed with minimal latency (e.g., in high-traffic dashboards).

Recommendation

The better approach depends on your specific needs:

Choose Option 1 (Store Repository-Level Statistics Only) If:

	•	Accuracy is critical (e.g., you need real-time, up-to-date statistics).
	•	Your system can handle the additional computational overhead during requests.
	•	You anticipate needing flexibility to calculate different team-level metrics dynamically (e.g., by filtering repositories or dates).

Choose Option 2 (Pre-Aggregate Team-Level Statistics) If:

	•	Performance and response time are critical (e.g., high-traffic dashboards).
	•	Team statistics change infrequently, and you can afford periodic updates.
	•	Your system prioritizes reduced database load over real-time accuracy.

Hybrid Approach

If neither approach fully satisfies your requirements, consider a hybrid approach:
	1.	Store repository-level statistics.
	2.	Pre-aggregate team-level statistics periodically (e.g., via a scheduled job or event-driven updates).
	3.	Use the pre-aggregated data for fast responses but fall back to dynamic aggregation if necessary (e.g., for real-time updates).

Example Implementation for Pre-Aggregation (Option 2):

	•	Team-Level Aggregated Table:

CREATE TABLE team_aggregates (
    team_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    total_closed_prs INT,
    total_open_prs INT,
    total_large_commits INT,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);


	•	Scheduled Job to Update Aggregates:

@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 * * * ?")  // Every hour
public void updateTeamAggregates() {
    List<FeatureTeam> teams = featureTeamRepository.findAll();
    for (FeatureTeam team : teams) {
        TeamAggregates aggregates = metricService.calculateTeamAggregates(team);
        teamAggregateRepository.save(aggregates);
    }
}


	•	Fetching Data:
	•	Use the team_aggregates table for most requests.
	•	Optionally aggregate in real-time if fresh data is needed.

This hybrid approach balances performance and flexibility, ensuring fast retrieval while maintaining the ability to display up-to-date statistics when required.
