The What â€“ What you have delivered

In 2025, one of my key objectives was to help the team effectively manage AWS server costs and improve our overall engineering efficiency.

To achieve this, I took a proactive approach to monitoring the usage of AWS instances across multiple clusters, regularly reminding colleagues to shut down idle servers to reduce unnecessary costs. I also developed automated monthly cost reports to visualize cost distribution and trends, enabling the team to better understand spending patterns and make informed decisions.

In addition, I implemented a backend API and integrated it with our Basecamp system to automatically retrieve and display cost data from AWS. This eliminated the need for manual updates, improved accuracy, and significantly enhanced the teamâ€™s visibility into cost management.

Beyond this, I contributed to two key initiatives that improved our engineering workflow:
	â€¢	Repository Migration: I helped migrate our codebase from Bitbucket to GitLab, ensuring smooth transition, version history integrity, and updated CI/CD configurations for all active projects.
	â€¢	Pipeline Enhancement: I integrated SonarQube into our Jenkins pipeline to automatically analyze code quality, coverage, and security vulnerabilities. This increased our visibility on technical debt, improved code consistency, and aligned the team with enterprise DevSecOps best practices.

These efforts collectively improved transparency, automation, and development quality across the team while directly supporting cost efficiency and engineering excellence.

ðŸŸ© The How â€“ How you performed in line with Barclays Values and Mindset

Throughout these projects, I consistently demonstrated Barclaysâ€™ values and mindset:
	â€¢	Integrity & Excellence: I ensured that all technical changesâ€”especially those involving automation and migrationâ€”were implemented transparently and rigorously tested, upholding high engineering and ethical standards.
	â€¢	Service & Stewardship: I focused on building sustainable, maintainable solutions that reduce future operational costs and effort, leaving systems in a stronger state than before.
	â€¢	Empower & Drive: I took ownership of complex tasks, such as configuring SonarQube and API automation, and proactively shared learnings with teammates to help them adopt these improvements in other projects.
	â€¢	Challenge: I questioned manual cost-tracking processes and proposed automated solutions that simplified workflows and improved accuracy, driving positive change through data-driven insights.
	â€¢	Collaborate: I worked closely with both DevOps and backend teams during the GitLab migration to ensure minimal disruption and effective communication across stakeholders.

By embodying these principles, I not only delivered tangible technical outcomes but also helped strengthen our teamâ€™s culture of accountability, innovation, and continuous improvement.
