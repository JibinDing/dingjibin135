To refresh team-level aggregated data (stored in the team_metrics table and related tables), you need to decide on an appropriate frequency and implement efficient methods for updating the data. Here’s how you can approach it:

1. Frequency of Data Refresh

Factors to Consider for Frequency
	•	Dashboard Usage: If the dashboard is accessed frequently and needs near real-time updates, refresh more frequently (e.g., every hour or every few minutes).
	•	Data Volume: Large datasets or APIs with rate limits might restrict how often you can fetch and process data.
	•	Performance Needs: Balance between data freshness and system load.

Recommended Frequencies
	1.	Hourly:
	•	Suitable for dashboards where near-real-time data isn’t critical but needs periodic updates.
	•	Example: Update team metrics, open pull requests, and large commits every hour.
	2.	Daily:
	•	Useful for teams that need only end-of-day summaries.
	•	Example: Run the aggregation job at midnight.
	3.	Custom Intervals:
	•	For real-time dashboards, refresh every 5–15 minutes (if data size and API usage allow it).

Example Decision:
	•	Use hourly refreshes for now, and adjust based on dashboard performance and usage patterns.

2. Methods for Refreshing Data

You can implement scheduled or event-driven approaches to refresh the stored team-level data. Here are the methods:

Method 1: Scheduled Job Using a Cron Job (Recommended)

Schedule a job to aggregate and update data periodically.

Using Spring Boot Scheduler (Java Example):

import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class DataAggregationService {

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 * * * ?") // Runs at the top of every hour
    public void refreshTeamLevelData() {
        List<FeatureTeam> teams = featureTeamRepository.findAll();

        for (FeatureTeam team : teams) {
            // Refresh team-level metrics
            TeamMetrics metrics = aggregateTeamMetrics(team);
            teamMetricsService.updateTeamMetrics(team, metrics);

            // Refresh open pull requests
            List<OpenPullRequest> openPullRequests = aggregateOpenPullRequests(team);
            openPullRequestService.saveOrUpdateAll(openPullRequests);

            // Refresh large commits
            List<LargeCommit> largeCommits = aggregateLargeCommits(team);
            largeCommitService.saveOrUpdateAll(largeCommits);
        }
        System.out.println("Team-level data refreshed at: " + LocalDateTime.now());
    }
}

Method 2: Event-Driven Updates

Trigger updates when certain events occur, such as:
	1.	New Commit or Pull Request: Refresh the metrics for the affected team.
	2.	Repository Changes: Detect changes (e.g., webhooks) and update the affected team data.

Example Workflow:
	1.	Listen to repository events via webhooks (e.g., GitHub or GitLab).
	2.	On receiving an event:
	•	Identify the affected team.
	•	Recompute team metrics, open pull requests, or large commits.

Method 3: Hybrid Approach
	•	Use a scheduled job for periodic full refresh (e.g., hourly).
	•	Use event-driven updates for incremental changes when events occur.

Example Strategy:
	•	Full refresh: Hourly using a scheduled job.
	•	Incremental updates: Triggered by commits, merges, or new pull requests using repository webhooks.

3. Efficient Refresh Techniques

Incremental Refresh
	•	Identify and update only the changes since the last refresh to reduce load.
	•	Track timestamps for updates (e.g., last_updated column in the database).

Example:
	•	Fetch only pull requests and commits created or updated after the last_updated timestamp.

public List<PullRequest> fetchUpdatedPullRequests(LocalDateTime lastUpdated) {
    return pullRequestAPI.getPullRequests()
        .stream()
        .filter(pr -> pr.getUpdatedDate().isAfter(lastUpdated))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
}

Batch Updates

Instead of updating records one at a time, use batch inserts or updates for performance.

Example (Using JPA or Hibernate for Batch Operations):

@Transactional
public void saveOrUpdateAll(List<OpenPullRequest> openPullRequests) {
    entityManager.unwrap(Session.class)
        .setJdbcBatchSize(50); // Set batch size
    for (int i = 0; i < openPullRequests.size(); i++) {
        entityManager.merge(openPullRequests.get(i));
        if (i % 50 == 0) { // Flush and clear batch
            entityManager.flush();
            entityManager.clear();
        }
    }
}

4. Monitoring and Logging
	•	Log the start and end time of each refresh job.
	•	Track errors during the refresh process to identify issues quickly.
	•	Use metrics and monitoring tools to ensure the refresh process is running efficiently.

Example Logging:

log.info("Team-level data refresh started at: {}", LocalDateTime.now());
// Perform data refresh
log.info("Team-level data refresh completed at: {}", LocalDateTime.now());

5. Database Cleanup

To prevent the database from growing indefinitely:
	•	Add a retention policy to remove stale data (e.g., open pull requests that were closed).
	•	Archive old records periodically.

Summary: Best Practices for Refreshing Team-Level Data
	1.	Frequency:
	•	Hourly refresh using scheduled jobs for team metrics, open pull requests, and large commits.
	•	Optionally, real-time incremental updates for important events (e.g., via webhooks).
	2.	Methods:
	•	Use scheduled cron jobs for periodic full refresh.
	•	Implement event-driven updates for real-time accuracy.
	3.	Efficiency:
	•	Use incremental updates where possible.
	•	Optimize database writes with batch updates.
	4.	Monitoring:
	•	Log job execution details and errors.
	•	Monitor performance and adjust frequency as needed.
