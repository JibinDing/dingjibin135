Here are suggestions to implement the second “team dashboard” based on your requirements:

1. How to Use the API for the New Dashboard

	•	API Design:
	•	If your repository dashboard API endpoints are modular (e.g., /repo/:repoId/metrics), you can reuse them by looping through all repositories in the team.
	•	Alternatively, you can create team-specific APIs like /team/:teamId/repos to fetch all repositories for a team and then fetch metrics for each repo using batch requests or aggregate on the backend.
	•	Batch Requests to GitLab API:
	•	Use GitLab API’s group-related endpoints (e.g., /groups/:groupId/projects) to retrieve all repositories belonging to a team.
	•	Make multiple requests for each repo (using existing repo metrics API).
	•	If rate limits are an issue, consider caching results offline (see point 3).
	•	Data Granularity:
	•	Ensure API responses are lightweight to avoid excessive data transfer, e.g., only retrieve metrics you need (closed/open PRs, large commits, etc.).

2. How to Aggregate Data from Different Repositories

	•	Approach:
	•	Fetch data for all repositories within a team.
	•	Aggregate based on metrics:
	•	Closed/Open/Merged PRs: Sum these counts across all repositories.
	•	Current Open Merge Requests: Combine lists from all repositories.
	•	Large Commits: Aggregate a list of large commits by appending them across repositories, optionally adding a repo identifier for context.
	•	Implementation Tips:
	•	Use a backend service (Spring Boot) to handle aggregation for better performance and reduced client-side complexity.
	•	For example:

@GetMapping("/team/{teamId}/metrics")
public TeamMetrics getTeamMetrics(@PathVariable String teamId) {
    List<RepoMetrics> repoMetricsList = fetchRepoMetricsForTeam(teamId);
    return aggregateMetrics(repoMetricsList);
}

3. Storing Data Offline

	•	Database:
	•	Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for structured data like PR counts or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) for JSON-like data storage if metrics vary.
	•	Design a schema to store:
	•	Team → Repositories
	•	Repository Metrics (PR counts, open PRs, large commits, etc.)
	•	Timestamped snapshots of data for historical analysis.
	•	Example Schema:
	•	teams table: team_id, team_name, etc.
	•	repositories table: repo_id, team_id, repo_name, etc.
	•	metrics table: repo_id, metric_type, metric_value, timestamp.

4. Refreshing Offline Data

	•	Refresh Strategy:
	•	Use a scheduled job or cron-like feature (e.g., Spring Scheduler) to periodically refresh data:

@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 * * * ?")  // Every hour
public void refreshTeamMetrics() {
    List<Team> teams = getAllTeams();
    teams.forEach(team -> updateTeamMetrics(team));
}


	•	Fetch and update data for all team repositories.

	•	Frequency:
	•	Choose the frequency based on how often data changes and API rate limits:
	•	High frequency (e.g., hourly) for dynamic metrics like open merge requests.
	•	Low frequency (e.g., daily) for historical/aggregate data (e.g., all-time PR data).
	•	Optimizing Refreshes:
	•	Use a “last updated” timestamp to avoid redundant data fetches.
	•	Fetch only deltas (changes) from GitLab API if supported.

Summary of Steps

	1.	API Use:
	•	Reuse existing repository-level API for modularity, or implement new team-level endpoints to handle aggregation.
	2.	Data Aggregation:
	•	Sum/merge repository metrics for team-wide views.
	•	Use backend services for aggregation to optimize client-side performance.
	3.	Offline Data Storage:
	•	Use a relational or NoSQL database to store team and repo metrics with timestamps for tracking.
	4.	Refreshing Data:
	•	Implement scheduled jobs with an appropriate frequency (hourly or daily).
	•	Optimize refreshes to fetch only updates or deltas.

This structure ensures scalability and efficient handling of team-wide metrics aggregation.
