Application Architecture Overview

Our application follows a modern web stack with a React.js frontend, a Node.js/Express.js backend, a MongoDB database, and a machine learning-based recommendation engine.
	•	Frontend: Built with React.js, it handles the user interface and communicates with the backend via APIs.
	•	Backend: Powered by Node.js and Express.js, it processes requests, handles authentication, and connects with the database.
	•	Database: Uses MongoDB with Mongoose for structured data management, storing user and content information.
	•	ML Component: A Python-based KNN recommendation engine analyzes user interactions to provide personalized suggestions.
	•	Deployment: Hosted on Barclays Container Platform (BCP) for scalability and security.

Data Flow: The frontend sends requests → The backend processes and retrieves data → The ML engine generates recommendations → Results are sent back to enhance user experience.

This architecture ensures modularity, scalability, and efficiency, delivering a seamless and personalized application.
