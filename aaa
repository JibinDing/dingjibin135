Application Architecture Overview

Our application is designed using a modern web stack, incorporating a React.js frontend, a Node.js backend with Express.js, a MongoDB database, and a machine learning-based recommendation engine.

Frontend Layer: React.js

The user interface is built using React.js, which is responsible for rendering components and managing the user experience. It communicates with the backend using API calls, sending and receiving data in real-time. The frontend primarily uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to provide a responsive and interactive experience.

Backend Layer: Node.js & Express.js

The backend is powered by Node.js, with Express.js handling server-side APIs. Express serves as the middleware between the frontend and backend, processing requests, handling authentication, and routing data appropriately.

Database Layer: MongoDB & Mongoose

The application uses MongoDB as the database, which stores user and content information in a NoSQL format. Data is managed through Mongoose, an ODM (Object-Document Mapper) that provides a structured way to interact with the database. The userDB database includes schemas for both users and contents, ensuring efficient data retrieval and management.

Machine Learning Component: ML Recommender Engine

A machine learning-based recommendation engine is integrated within the backend. It uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier, implemented in Python, to generate personalized recommendations for users based on their interactions and preferences.

Infrastructure & Deployment: Barclays Container Platform (BCP)

The entire application is deployed and managed using the Barclays Container Platform (BCP), ensuring scalability, security, and efficient resource utilization.

Data Flow
	1.	The React.js frontend sends user interactions to the backend via API requests.
	2.	Express.js processes these requests and interacts with the database through Mongoose.
	3.	Data is stored and retrieved from MongoDB, where it is structured into user and content schemas.
	4.	The ML recommender engine processes user behavior and generates personalized recommendations.
	5.	The results are sent back to the frontend, providing a seamless user experience.

This architecture ensures modularity, scalability, and efficiency, leveraging modern web technologies to deliver a dynamic and personalized application.
